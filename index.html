    <h1>Elizabeth Kleinschmidt</h1>
    <div class= "boxes" id= "bio">
      <h1>We call her Liz...</h1>
      <h5>(or Elizabeth, it really doesn't matter)</h5>
      <p>Liz(Elizabeth) was born in New Hampshire, but she doesn't know much about it, so don't ask!</p>
      <p>When she was 3, her family moved to California, which is essentially where she grew-up. The problem with California, however, is the darned sun. Elizabeth doesn't tan, ever, not even slightly!</p>
      <p>Fed up with sunburns, she moved to Seattle, Washington! A mystical place rumored to be covered in clouds...</p>
    </div>
    <div class= "boxes" id= "edu">
      <h1>Schooled</h1>
      <p>Elizabeth's education has mostly been along the lines of "drop a child in the deep end of the pool and see if it swims".</p>
      <p>We've yet to see if this will stick.</p>
      <p>Time will tell.</p>
    </div>
    <div class= "boxes" id= "exp">
      <h1>Okay, so what has Liz <span>done</span>?</h1>
      <p>Elizabeth apparently loves messing around with computers enough to take classes that teach her to mess with them more.</p>
      <p>Whether complete strangers will trust her with their websites is questionable, currently she likes fiddling with the organization of what will never be seen anyways.</p>
    </div>
    <div class= "boxes" id= "fun">
      <h1>What does Liz do for fun?</h1>
      <p>So many things! A suprising amount of stuff can be done inside. Safe, away from the rays of the sun...
      <ul>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Travelling (indoors, somehow...)</li>
        <li>Sculpting</li>
        <p> and <em>now</em>...</p>
        <li>Coding!</li>
