      <h2>We call her Liz...</h2>
      <p>(or Elizabeth, it really doesn't matter)</p>
      <p>Liz(Elizabeth) was born in New Hampshire, but she doesn't know much about it, so don't ask!</p>
      <p>When she was 3, her family moved to California, which is essentially where she grew-up. The problem with California, however, is the darned sun. Elizabeth doesn't tan, ever, not even slightly!</p>
      <p>Fed up with sunburns, she moved to Seattle, Washington! A mystical place rumored to be covered in clouds...</p>

      <h2>Schooled</h2>
      <p>Elizabeth's education has mostly been along the lines of "drop a child in the deep end of the pool and see if it swims".</p>
      <p>We've yet to see if this will stick.</p>
      <p>Time will tell.</p>

      <h2>Okay, so what has Liz <span>done</span>?</h2>
      <p>Elizabeth apparently loves messing around with computers enough to take classes that teach her to mess with them more.</p>
      <p>Whether complete strangers will trust her with their websites is questionable, currently she likes fiddling with the organization of what will never be seen anyways.</p>
      <p>Things Liz can do:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook</li>
        <li>Annoy</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="boxes" id="fun">
      <h2>What does Liz do for fun?</h2>
      <p>So many things! A suprising amount of stuff can be done inside. Safe, away from the rays of the sun...</p>

        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Travelling (indoors, somehow...)</li>
